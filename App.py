Focus only on the Basic, Minimum, and Preferred Qualifications/Requirements sections to guide your extraction.

Your task is to update the LaTeX-formatted "Technical Skills" section below by doing the following:

Retain the LaTeX format exactly as-is, including section headers, spacing, and syntax.

Do not modify the Certifications section.

Limit the total number of categories to no more than 6.

Only include clearly technical skills (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, libraries, tools, platforms). Avoid concepts like "data analysis" or "causal inference."

When adding tools or technologies, prefer specific technologies over broad categories.

‚úÖ For example, replace:

"Relational Databases" ‚Üí PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server

"Non-Relational Databases" ‚Üí MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB

"Cloud Platforms" ‚Üí AWS, Azure, GCP

"ETL Tools" ‚Üí Airflow, AWS Glue, dbt

Only include technologies that can be justified through projects or experience (i.e., don't list anything that isn't referenced elsewhere in the resume).

Do not label any skills as ‚Äúpreferred‚Äù or ‚Äúfamiliar,‚Äù even if sourced from the Preferred Qualifications section.

Ensure the final output consists of:
‚úÖ the updated Technical Skills section (in LaTeX format), followed by
‚úÖ the unchanged Certifications section below it.

Begin your modifications from the LaTeX section provided below, and return only the updated LaTeX output.

This is the Job Description which starts here:

{content}
""",rf"""Important Task Begins Here

You will be provided with a job description at the end of this prompt. Your task is to generate strong, technically accurate, and quantifiable resume bullet points that align with the role ‚Äî going far beyond generic rewording of job descriptions.

üß† Guidelines for Output
Most importantly, extract and include only high-value, ATS-friendly technical keywords directly from the job description. 

Your bullet points must reflect real-world experience ‚Äî not repeat vague responsibilities or use abstract concepts.

Use precise technical language that clearly demonstrates impact, tools, and outcomes.

Avoid using action verbs repetitively (e.g., avoid repeating ‚ÄúDeveloped,‚Äù ‚ÄúBuilt,‚Äù ‚ÄúImplemented‚Äù). Vary the structure of sentences ‚Äî for example, start with the impact or outcome first, followed by how it was achieved.

Please donot reference the name of the company in the bullet points anywhere

Also Highlight the qunaitifiable impacts in each Bullet point using \textbf{{}}

Eliminate fluff or generic terms (like ‚Äúmachine learning algorithms,‚Äù ‚Äúdata-driven insights,‚Äù ‚Äúcross-functional teams‚Äù) unless justified with details.

Ensure all claims are realistic and justifiable ‚Äî no vague buzzwords or unsupported metrics.

‚úÖ Formatting Instructions
Use LaTeX bullet point format (see example below).

Escape special characters (e.g., %, $, &).

Each bullet should be a full sentence and clearly express:

What was done

How it was done

What the measurable outcome was 

Kind of Like STAR method,

S - What was the Situation
T - What was the Task to be done
A - What was the Action take
R - What was the Result

Just See some examples here how star format looks like

Created dashboards using Tableau for the finance team (What), by automating weekly reporting with filters and visual KPIs (How), which saved 8 hours/week and improved decision-making speed (Impact).
Cleaned and standardized vendor payment data (What), using Python and Excel to process exports from SAP (How), resulting in 20% higher invoice accuracy and fewer downstream payment issues (Impact).

And Also Make Sure they Sound like how a Human would write it, little imperfect rather than being written by LLM

Your final output should consist of 7 bullet points in LaTeX format only.
